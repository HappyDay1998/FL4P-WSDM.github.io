### Introduction

Using data from multiple parties is becoming popular in AI model learning. The algorithm research serving this purpose is known as
federated learning, which has received increasing attention from both academic and industry. As a generic solution to data insufficiency, federated learning has demonstrated high potential in numerous web search and data mining problems. Moreover, the widespread data use in web search and data mining services and products has aroused concern on data privacy protection. Therefore, we propose to organize a workshop discussing the relevant issues. In this proposal we introduce the detail of the workshop motivation, topics, rational, format, and organizers’ information.

We propose to organize this Federated and Privacy-Preserving Web Search and Data Mining: Theories, Algorithms and Applications Workshop, aiming to gather the academic and industry community together to tackle the theory, algorithm and application issues of using decentralized data in web search and data mining applications.

#### Motivation

AI services have been ubiquitous in web search and data mining applications. The accuracy, generalization and robustness of an AI model heavily rely on learning from sufficient training data. However, in many cases, the data owned by one individual AI practitioner is insufficient to train a high-performance model. For example, one healthcare institution typically only has the clinical data collected from the local patients, leading to potential model bias if only local data is used for model training. As another example, one individual or business organization usually has multiple accounts in different financial agencies. The fraud detection model can not make accurate predictions if financial transaction data from only one bank is used for training and inference. Recently, there are extensive efforts from both academia and industry dedicated to tackling the above challenges. One prominent branch is generally known as collaborative learning or federated learning. The main theme is to utilize data from multiple parties for model learning and prediction. In the past few years we have seen an explosive number of research publications relevant to these topics, and several pioneering industry deployments that apply the relevant technologies such as personalized Siri service in Apple’s iOS 13 and next word prediction function in Google’s Gboard. Despite the encouraging progress, there are still several significant research questions which have not been completely addressed, including but not limited to the following points.

**Data privacy.** Privacy is viewed as an essential human right. The widespread use of personal data in AI services and products has aroused increasing concerns for user privacy and data ownership violation. This concern is even more serious towards multi-party computing applications. There have been increasing legislation endeavors on data privacy protection, e.g. European Union General Data Protection Regulation and California Consumer Privacy Act. Every data use for AI purpose is also subject to these regulations.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/HappyDay1998/FL4P-WSDM.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
